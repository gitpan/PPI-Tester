=head1 NAME

PPI::Tester - A wxPerl-based interactive PPI debugger/tester

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package implements a wxWindows desktop application which provides the
ability to interactively test the PPI perl parser.

The C<PPI::Tester> module implements the application, but is itself of no
use to the user. The launcher for the application 'ppitester' is installed
with this module, and can be launched by simply typing the following from
the command line.

  ppitester

When launched, the application consists of two vertical panels. The left
panel is where you should type in your code sample. As the left hand panel
is changed, a PPI::Lexer::Dump output is continuously updated in the right
hand panel.

There is a toolbar at the top of the application with two icon buttons,
currently without icons. The first toolbar button clears the panels, the
second is a placeholder for loading in code from a file, and is not yet
implemented. ( It's early days yet for this application ).

=head1 TO DO

- The "Load file" toolbar button does not work yet

- There are no icons on the toolbar buttons

- An option is needed to save both the left and right panels into
  a matching pair of files, compatible with the lexer testing script.
